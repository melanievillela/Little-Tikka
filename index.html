    <h1>Little Tikka</h1>
    <p class="text align-center">
      Little Tikka looked like your average toddler boy. Short with a big head and little body. He had long, wavy, dark brown hair that went to his shoulders. 
      People often mistook him for baby Tarzan. Don't let his charming looks fool you though. He was extremely sneaky and cunning and he wasn't here for your affection. 
      You can keep your hugs and kisses to yourself.<br>He was on a special secret mission.

    <p class="text align-center">
      Now I know what you must be thinking. How can a little person shorter than a tree trunk possible be part of a covert mission to drive the two people in the world 
      that would do anything for him insane? Keep reading, you're about to find out.

        Little Tikka looked up. There was that white object that spinned and occasionally emitted a bright light. He wasn't sure why yet but occasionally, seemingly 
        from nowhere, gazing up at this mysterious object would send him into a fit of laughter. He looked around. "Mommy" was nowhere in sight. 
        Neither was "Daddy". This was perfect. He had time to start putting his plan to action. 
      </p>
      <p class="text align-left">
        You see Little Tikka didn't originally plan on wreaking havoc on these two. He quite enjoyed his last place of residence when it was just him and Mommy 
        as roomates. He had plenty of room to stretch, his surroundings were kept at a perfect temperature and meals were served in a decent amount of time. 
        Life was good. Things started to change though. Slowly at first but towards the end he knew he had to get out.

        It started out innocently enough and in fact Little Tikka enjoyed the classical music that he heard as he did his morning routine of arm and leg extensions. 
        It was quite soothing and he felt that the music inspired him to ponder the meaning of life. One day though, he heard a loud thumping noise and then a mans 
        voice who he later identified as Daddy. "Get ready little man" Daddy said. What he heard next was something out of a horror movie.

        Close your eyes<br>
        Look deep in your soul<br>
        Step outside yourself<br>
        And let your mind go
      </p>
      <p class="text align-right">
        Little Tikka was beside himself. This was completely unnaceptable. He wanted to file a grievance. He pulled the special cord that was used to request various 
        meals throughout the day. He waited patiently but nothing. He was sure the mommy could here this awful noise as well. In a fit of anger he kicked out as 
        hard as he could.

        Melanie woke up with a start. "What's wrong?" Ruben asked her with a look of concern on his face. "The baby kicked really hard" she replied looking down and 
        rubbing her stomache. She grabbed one of the bellybuds and put it up to her ear. "What the hell is this crap?" she yelled yanking the other bellybud from her 
        stomache. Ruben looked affronted. "It's better than that sissy music you put on" he replied. Melanie narrowed her eyes at him. "I'm the one getting feedback and 
        he doesn't like it. Besides, listening to classical music will stimulate his brain cells and make him smarter". She smiled with a look of smug satisfaction. 
        Let him argue against a smarter baby she thought. Ruben had learned a long time ago which battles to fight. "You hungry? I'm going to go buy me some smokes" 
        he said as he walked out the room and down the stairs.
